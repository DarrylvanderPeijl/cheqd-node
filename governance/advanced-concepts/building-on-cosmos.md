# Building on Cosmos

cheqd’s Network is built using the Cosmos SDK, which means that it can inherit a lot of the core functionality of Cosmos. 

Notably, for this Governance Framework, we will often refer to specifications laid out in Cosmos’ SDK documentation, [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.42/modules/gov/).

Importantly, cheqd is an Application Specific Blockchain. This means that Users of the cheqd Network have full control over the entire chain and are not reliant on Cosmos at all. This ensures the community will not be stuck if, for example,  a bug in the Cosmos hub or Inter-Blockchain Communication is discovered, and that it has the entire freedom to choose how it is going to evolve.

However, it is worth noting that once the Network has departed from Cosmos’ initial foundation, it will no longer be able to seamlessly update itself to Cosmos’ latest functionality. 

For this reason, it is suggested that the Network mirrors Cosmos’ architecture and updates, especially during the initial stages of its lifecycle.
