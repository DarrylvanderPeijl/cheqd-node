## Community

You do not have to own any CHEQ to participate in our community discussion. You are free to learn about cheqd and participate in our community discussions across multiple platforms and forums.

We want learning about cheqd and participating in the community to be easy and accessible. For this reason, we have decided to host our wiki, our source code and our discussion forum, all in one place. 

1. [Github](https://github.com/cheqd): Here we will host:
   1. Our Wiki page, with all formal documentation YOU need to know about cheqd, including this Governance Framework;
   2. Our open sourced code;
   3. A forum for discussion relevant to specific topics, issues and proposals. This is a space for you to make suggestions and proposals on how you want to improve cheqd, as well as participate in discussion with the community. 

If you want to stay updated with cheqd news, we recommend that you join us on:

1. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheqd_io): Follow us here to keep up to date with the latest cheqd news and to be the first to hear about special announcements;
2. [Telegram](https://t.me/cheqd): Join our community here to participate in general conversation about cheqd with our core community following and be the first to hear about special announcements.
3. [Discord:](https://discord.gg/SQA8NpVe2v) Discord is a fantastic way to discuss topics in a more structured way, across specific channels related to your interests. 

We also kindly ask you to familiarise yourself with our Code of Conduct which sets our clearly defined expectations and behaviour that we want to uphold in the community.  

1. [cheqd Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rbw-0TMg8PZO85R0SuDKffXnwrDTzcPrSrURPI3el7c/edit)

This ensures that the cheqd community remains a safe and welcoming place, for any person regardless of who they are.
